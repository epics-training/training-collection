# Training-Collection

This repository works as a parent for the other modules
in the epics-training organization,
which are linked as git submodules.

For a given training course, it contains a branch or a tag
under the slug (short name) of that course.
Checking out this repository using the slug
will create all training modules for the training course
in the versions that were used at the event.
